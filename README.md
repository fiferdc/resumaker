Separate content and design to easily build resumes

Resumes grow and change over time.  Some changes may introduce the dreaded second page.  Others may show that the existing design no longer is best suited to showcase the skills in the resume.  This project is meant to address both concerns by separating the content of the resume from the design and letting the user have full control over the generation of the resume.
